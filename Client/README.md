Here's a draft for a README file for the client module of your project:

# R-Type Client

The R-Type Client is part of a multiplayer game framework that communicates with the server to enable real-time gameplay interactions. It serves as the graphical front-end, handling user inputs, rendering the game window, and exchanging messages with the server over UDP.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Networking**: Utilizes Boost.Asio for asynchronous communication with the game server.
- **Rendering**: Powered by the SFML library for game window management and graphical rendering.
- **Event Handling**: Processes user inputs (keyboard events) and translates them into actions sent to the server.
- **Multithreading**: Leverages separate threads for network I/O and game rendering to ensure smooth gameplay.

---

## Project Overview

The R-Type Client connects to a specified game server and interacts via a UDP socket. It sends player actions (e.g., movement) to the server and updates the game state based on responses received. The client implements a simple ECS (Entity-Component-System) model for game object management, allowing modular and scalable development.

---

## Features

- **Bidirectional Communication**: Supports sending player actions and receiving game state updates.
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Displays updated game visuals based on player and server interactions.
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed to run on multiple operating systems with minimal adjustments.
